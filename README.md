🛠️ Technologies Used
- **HTML5** 📄: Semantic structure for the webpage.
- **Tailwind CSS** 🎨: Utility-first CSS framework for styling.
- **Vite** ⚡: Fast development server and build tool.
- **Feather Icons** 🖌️: Lightweight icons loaded via CDN.
- **CSS Animations** ✨: Custom keyframes for the companies banner.


🔍 How It Works
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS processes utility classes (e.g., `bg-deepBlue`, `hover:scale-105`) into `styles.css` via Vite and PostCSS.
- **Development**: Vite serves the project during development, providing hot reloading for quick iteration.
- **Animations**: The "Join Razorpay" section features a scrolling banner (`companiesbanner`) animated with CSS keyframes.
- **Icons**: Feather Icons are loaded via CDN and rendered with `feather.replace()`.
- **Production**: Vite builds an optimized `dist/` folder with purged CSS and bundled assets.
